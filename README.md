Renpy Project build for Serious Games VIP <br />
To install and work using Renpy <br />

  1) Download the latest version of Renpy here: https://www.renpy.org/latest.html <br />
  2) In the renpydev folder where you installed Renpy, clone this repo into a single folder (like /renpydev/SeriousGames/) <br />
          the folder mine is cloned into was renpy-8.0.3-sdk, might be a different version if it updated <br />
          ex: my pathway looks like renpy-8.0.3-sdk\SeriousGames
  3) In the renpy folder (renpy-8.0.3-sdk or whatever your main install folder is, open the renpy application
  4) you should be able to see a screen with the Serious Games, click "Launch Project" to open the game
  5) To work on and edit the project, click "Open Project"

  the screen should look like this once renpy is open. <br />
There is a tutorial to help understand how to do various elements, if you have any other questions feel free to ask. 

PROJECT NOTE
- when adding images, renpy cannot see image file names that have a capital letter! I don't know why, but it will error out the image.
