          the folder mine is cloned into was renpy-8.0.3-sdk, might be a different version if it updated
          ex: my pathway looks like renpy-8.0.3-sdk\SeriousGames
  3) In the renpy folder (renpy-8.0.3-sdk or whatever your main install folder is, open the renpy application
  4) you should be able to see a screen with the Serious Games, click "Launch Project" in the bottom right corner to open the game
  5) To work on and edit the project, click "Open Project"
